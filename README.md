- I have used local storage to make data persist.
- You can add, remove, update income, and expense items.
- This will also show us the percentage of each expense item w.r.t total 
income.
- You can delete all items at once with delete all button
- Bar Chart will show the budget percentage w.r.t (income+expense)
- It uses a ring chart to display and indicate the amount of budget left for the month after analyzing and calculating the balance budget
 from the income earned and the expenditure made.
