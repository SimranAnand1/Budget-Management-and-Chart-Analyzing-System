- I've used local storage to make data persist.
- You can add, remove, edit income, and expense items.
- This will also show you the percentage of each expense item w.r.t total 
income.
- You can delete all items at once with delete all button
- Bar Chart will show the budget percentage w.r.t (income+expense)

Any suggestions or improvements are most welcome.
